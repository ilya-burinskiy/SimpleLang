# SimpleLang
Compiler theory

Each SimpleLang instruction begins with one of the following commands: let, input, print, goto, if/goto. 
The language operates only with integer (2 bytes in size) expressions.

Variable names start with a letter or underscore and contain an arbitrary number of letters, numbers, or underscores

In the if / goto operator, the following relations operations are allowed: <,>, <=,> =, ==, or <> (not equal).

The result of the compiler's work is pseudo assembly code or an error message.
